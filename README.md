# wheat-rea-migration-analysis
This repository hosts the main code for generating the RF model and figures for "Accelerating SDGs progress in Chinese wheat production through water-driven migration and sustainable intensification".

R version 4.2.0 (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) was used to aggregate and analyze the modeling results.

Some packages are necessary being loaded prior to running it (e.g., randomForest, dplyr, tidyverse, hydroGOF, rio, easynls).

All of the code and raw data (RF model) to produce the numerical values reported in the analysis are available in these files.

This is research code and may require more detailed assistance to be fully functional. We can provide technical help if readers are interested.
